## Description

Testing if a new drug lowers blood pressure more effectively than an old drug.

**Hypothesis**
- Null Hypothesis (H₀): There is no difference in the blood pressure reduction between the new and old drugs.
- Alternative Hypothesis (H₁): The new drug lowers blood pressure more effectively than the old drug.

**Group Formation**
- We have randomly picked up patients from the each group being treated by old drug and new drug. 

**Sample Size**
- Sample size is 30. We checked the reduction level in 30 patients in each group.

## Technologies-used

Python programming language, pandas and matplotlib package.

## Dataset

The data set is synthetically generated and used for demonstrating the concept only. The program can be easily modified to show results with real readings taken from the patients.

## Program-codes

The programs are written on jupiter notebook, You may run the program on Google colab by clicking on the colab badge below.

### Conclusion
Now we have strong evidence to conclude that the new drug significantly reduces blood pressure more effectively than the old drug.
